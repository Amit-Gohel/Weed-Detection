# Weed-Detection

The project aims to develop an automatic weed detection system using the YOLOv5 algorithm. The system will be trained to identify weeds in agricultural images or videos and locate their position.

The steps involved in this project are:

1) Data collection: Gather a dataset of images that contain weeds and label the weed instances
2) Model training: Train the YOLOv5 model using the annotated data
3) Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to measure its accuracy
4) Deployment: Deploy the trained model on a device or application for use in the field

The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of weed detection and control in agriculture, reducing the time and cost spent on manual inspection and increasing crop yields. The success of the project will depend on the quality of the data, the accuracy of the model, and the ability to deploy it effectively in real-world scenarios.
